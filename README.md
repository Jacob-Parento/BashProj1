Repisitory for IT3038C Bash Project 1
Created by Jacob Parento

This project takes a file passed to it and removes all "filler words" and punctuation to allow for easier scanning for key words. I used a sed to remove punctuation, and I'm not entirely sure how crediting/sourcing works when it comes to programming courses so I want to make it abundantly clear the specific sed [punct] method was taken from this Stack Overflow: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/692160/how-do-you-remove-all-punctuation-using-the-sed-command. You should be able to see it in the comments as well. The other aspects were ripped from prior assignments since I'd basically be writing the same thing anyway.

I used the US constitution as example text because old timey articles & proclimations use a *ton* of these to sound grandiose.

Because the file is rather simple, I offer a simple video to sate attention for just a little longer.
